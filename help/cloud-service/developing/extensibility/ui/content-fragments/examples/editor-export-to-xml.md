# 将内容片段导出到XML

![内容片段编辑器标题菜单扩展示例](./assets/export-to-xml/hero.png){align="center"}

可以使用将自定义按钮添加到内容片段编辑器标题菜单 `headerMenu` 扩展点。 此示例说明如何向标题菜单添加按钮，以及如何处理点击事件，以将活动内容片段导出为XML或CSV。

标题按钮可以作为一个按钮存在，也可以作为具有子项目的按钮存在。 此示例说明如何使用子项实施按钮，但包含用于实施单个按钮的注释掉的代码。

## 扩展点

此示例扩展到扩展点 `headerBar` 以向内容片段编辑器添加自定义按钮。

| AEM UI已扩展 | 扩展点 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | 
| [内容片段控制台](https://developer.adobe.com/uix/docs/services/aem-cf-editor/) | [标题菜单](https://developer.adobe.com/uix/docs/services/aem-cf-editor/api/header-menu/) |

## 扩展示例

以下示例创建一个标头菜单按钮，该按钮包含两个子项，一个用于将活动内容片段导出为XML（已实施），另一个用于将活动内容片段导出为CSV（未实施）。

该代码显示了如何在扩展的注册文件中获取内容片段的内容，以及如何导出内容片段的JSON内容。

### 延期注册

`ExtensionRegistration.js`，映射到index.html路由，是AEM扩展的入口点，并定义：

+ 此时将显示扩展按钮的位置(`headerMenu`AEM )创作体验
+ getButton()函数中扩展按钮的定义
+ 按钮的点击处理程序(在onClick()函数中)或子项列表及其点击处理程序中)。

#### 内容片段数据

可以使用检索活动内容片段 `getContentFragment()` 上的方法 `guestConnection.host.contentFragment` 对象。

```javascript
const contentFragment = await guestConnection.host.contentFragment.getContentFragment();
```

此 `contentFragment` 对象包含有关内容片段的所有信息，包括路径、模型、元数据、主内容和任何变体。
